## Overview of School District Analysis
I’ve prepared math and reading test scores, along with other data points, for analysis and reporting to offer valuable insight into performance trends and patterns. One file shows evidence of being altered and a new analysis is needed to replace Thomas High School 9th grade test scores with “Not a Number” or NaNs until the school board can further investigate the situation.

## Results
- The district summary was not affected by replace Thomas High School 9th grade test scores with “Not a Number” or NaN.
